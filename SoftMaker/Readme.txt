COSMETIC WINDOWS VISTA ISSUE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In one specific situation (Aero user interface, maximized document
window, maximized application window, Windows Sidebar turned off), 
Windows Vista shifts the application scrollbars of MDI applications a
few pixels to the left.

This affects all SoftMaker Office applications and any other 
Multiple Document Interface (MDI) application. It is an obvious bug 
in the operating system, but just a cosmetic one. It causes no 
malfunctions in the applications, and we are certain that Microsoft
will fix it in the future.
